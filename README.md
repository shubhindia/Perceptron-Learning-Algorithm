# Perceptron-Learning-Algorithm
Perceptron Learning Algorithm implemented in python

This is a submission for the 1st part of the 4th project of this [course]( https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-ai-columbiax-csmm-101x).

The task is to implement the Perceptron Learning Algorithm for a linearly separable dataset.

With every iteration of the PLA the program prints out a new line to the output file, containing a comma-separated list of the weights.(w1, w2, w0)

## The program is executed like so:
 python pla.py "inputFileName" "outputFileName" where:
 
 1. inputFileName is the name of the file containing the data to be linearly separated which must contain two colums of feature values 
 and one column of label values
 2. outputFileName is the name of the file where the result will be printed
